Lipuma is a tool for drawing fantasy maps quickly and efficiently!

This tool is still in early beta, but can be used to quickly generate natural looking river and coastline formations for maps.

These basic beginnings are already a wonderful speedup to the map making process, allowing for laying out the basics of a map quickly before moving into artistic details in another tool
