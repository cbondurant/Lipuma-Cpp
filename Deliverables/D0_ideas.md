## Idea 1: Vector based map creation tool

### The problem

For Dungeon Masters, Game Masters, and anyone else interested in the field of worldbuilding, there always comes a time where you wish to create a map. Maps are a wonderful way of visualizing the world you have created, giving it depth, and understanding the geographic features in a way near impossible with only a mental landscape. However I find the tools to do this that currently exist to be mostly lacking. As there are a number of geographic features that are very difficult to recreate in meaningful ways with the current fantasy map creation tools. Most notable to me being the fractal nature of many natural features, such as coastlines, rivers, roads, and more.

In short, I want the tool of my dreams, and who better to make it than me.

### Who would use it?

I know a number of other fantasy writers, world builders, and dnd DM's that have expressed frustration with the lack of viable tools for this purpose. I want to be able to fill the full suite of things I expect them to want to do.

Such features include:

- Vector based graphics, that allow for scaling the maps generated to any size, for use in printing.
- The ability to export renders of the map, or segments of the map, to a number of formats, including PNG, JPEG, WEBP, to allow for using the maps in virtual tabletop engines such as Roll20 and FoundryVTT
- Importing of vector "stamps" that can be placed to add details that would be best designed in alternative programs such as adobe illustrator

### Modality

This would be best suited as a downloadable executable, to most effectively make use of the power of a user's computer when managing complex or otherwise large maps, with many detailed features.

5, this is the project that I am most interested in bringing to completion.

## Idea 2: Binary hex editor with data visualization extentions

### The problem

When reverse engineering binary file formats, its often the case that you need to make guesses at how data is being used at certain blocks in the file, this can be slow going as it often requires writing entire loaders and modifying source code while going through the rough analysis process. It would be useful to use hotkey based commands to mark parts of a file as certain kinds of data and attempt to view them as if they are that kind of data. Including but not limited to viewing raw encoded RGB data, node point data, Easily highlighting where an address may point to in other parts of a file, and more. 

### Who would use it?

Reverse engineers and cybersecurity specialists attempting to more quickly analyize malicious software.

### Modality

This would only make sense as a desktop program, as often files that are analysed like this can be in the megabyte range and are not preferable to be loaded in a web browser.

### Enthusiasm
3, I have seen other projects that are beginning to attempt this same endevor, but none currently exist in a finished state.

## Idea 3: Open Source Contribution Project

### The problem

There are a number of open source projects that I use on a regular basis that could benefit from additional support and assistance.

### who would use it?

These projects already have a dedicated userbase

### Modality

N/A

### Enthusiasm

Honestly this is here to fill a third slot, 1
