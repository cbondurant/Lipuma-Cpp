## Accomplishments

I have begun doing user testing for my program.
As well as making a proper windows build for my program to allow more users to test.

## Challenges

I had to go through the complicated and difficult process of working out issues in my build chain. This was eventually resolved though.

## Next Steps

I have obtained a number of glitches that need resolving in my code from user testing with a friend.

I want to first add them all into my issue tracker so that I can triage them, this should take an hour or so.
Then I will focus first on resolving the issue where saving and loading breaks tool selection, I think this will take a few days.
Finally I want to do some quality of life improvmenents, Such as un-inverting scroll. improving the selection bounding boxes, and other issues I have notes for. This will probably take a while to iron all the kinks out.
