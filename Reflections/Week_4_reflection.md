## Accomplishments

Ultimately this week was a week of decision paralysis. The roadblock that I had faced with implementing the iterator syntax was enough to completely freeze me from getting any meaningful work done. I am also writing this reflection late, as a result of this mental block.

## Challenges

This week had no real challenges in the technical sense, but instead some mental challenges of trying to motivate myself on a problem that had taxed me mentally to work on.

## Next Steps

As of writing this, I have begun working on a file storage interface, and after a small amount of hurdles to jump I was able to continue working on it cleanly without issue. my motivation has improved a lot.

## Resources

No specific resources for this week so far.
